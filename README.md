# Balloon-Massacre

There are a lot of games to play at the night markets in Taiwan. 
One game I have decided to interpret in a Unity game is a balloon shooting game.
Please note that this repo only holds the game's scripts. The game also has a VR and AR version.

# Objective 
The objective of the game is to successfully shoot all of the 15 balloons with a dart gun before the 30 second timer ends,
without accidentally shooting another night market visitor who randomly walks by.

# Gameplay 
As a balloon is hit, the game text updates the score to let you know how many more balloons you need to hit in order to win. 
If a walking-by person is shot, the game is lost. The player can shoot as many bullets as he/she wants, but only every other two seconds.

# Controllers 
The gun shoots a dart with the left mouse button. The gun is able to aim by moving the mouse around. 
After the dart has been shot, the player is able to slightly curve the shot with the arrow keys. A new game is started by pressing "Y".

# Environment 
The environment is built to look like a night market, with adjacent similar market booths. 
In the background there are houses, trees, benches, light posts etc., just like in real life. The game takes place at night, 
and the balloon wall has a spotlight to highlight which balloons the player needs to hit.
